## Please be considerate

The time and work spent on HTI is unpaid. I'm very happy to help you work through any difficulties that you're having while using HTI. I just ask that you first do the following before asking for help:

- Read the Hugo documentation
- Search the issues on this repository to see if your problem or question has already been addressed
- Make an effort to figure out what the problem is on your own first


If you've gone through the above, please do ask your question here and I'll do my best to get to it as quickly as possible.

Please list the documentation pages that you've read, or the resources that you found while researching this on your own in your request for assistance.
